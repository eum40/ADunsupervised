**Title:** Understanding Alzheimer's Disease Hidden Clusters: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach

Neurocognitive impairments, including dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), are serious public health concerns costing billions of dollars to our nation. AD, the most common type of dementia, is a progressive neurocognitive disease effecting millions of individuals in the U.S. According to the Alzheimer's Association (2025), over 7 million Americans live with AD, and by 2050, this number is expected to be 13 million Americans. AD was also the sixth-leading cause of death among those aged 65 and older in 2022 (Alzheimer's Association, 2025).

Epidemiological studies have long revealed that the clinical presentation of AD’s is complicated and heterogeneous, impacted by various biopsychosocial factors. Due to involvement of many biopsychosocial factors, clinicians and researchers experience significant challenges for early detection and prevention, prognosis, and intervention.

Most research studies in AD and dementia rely on clinical categories and simple supervised learning models causing significant challenges to estimate or understand latent variables or substructures among this population. This is a significant issue given some patient groups may not fit well to the diagnostic criteria but still experience AD. Therefore, it is importnat to highlight that unsupervised learning models may provide options to researchers to examine those latent or unstructured variables or groups or patterns which could help us create meaningful and multidimensional models explanining AD. 

In this project, I wanted to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques, including clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques, to identify clinically relevant subgroups among individuals assessed for AD. This analysis will focus on three specific aims with one research question:

**RQ:** Can we detect meaningful patterns or subgroups among patients based on cognitive, physical, and behavioral health features using unsupervised learning?"

**Aim 1:** Examine underlying factors in demographic, lifestyle, and cognitive features;

**Aim 2:** Determine potential clusters of patients with similar risk profiles;

**Aim 3:** Visualizing high-dimensional patient data to better capture heterogeneity among patients;

This data was obtained from the Kaggle via El Kharoua (2024) via http://kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset.
